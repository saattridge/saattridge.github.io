				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>I am a highly organized and methodical individual with a passion for software/web development. I was the sole owner and operator of a website design/hosting company for several years. Also, I have tutored in computer science and physics coursework. In addition to my employment in web development and academia, I have an extensive knowledge of both PC and laptop hardware internals/upgrades and have been building and repairing computers for over 25 years.

My success in academia, adaptability to new technologies, and desire to develop the skills needed for success are parallel to the qualities desired in industry. </p></div>
